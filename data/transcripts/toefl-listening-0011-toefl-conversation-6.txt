Yes, how can I help you?
I'd like to buy a campus parking pass for next year.
Certainly. Did you want a limited or unlimited?
And just for fall quarter, or for the entire school year?
I was thinking of one for the whole year, but I'm not sure.
Does the year include summer quarter?
'Cause I won't be here then.
No, summer term is extra.
The year includes fall, winter and spring quarters.
A yearly pass is valid only from the start of fall term to the end of spring term.
This year, that's, uh, let's see...
September 22nd to June 7th.
Oh, OK.
And you said there were two different kinds? Uh, limited and unlimited?
Yes. A limited pass lets you park in any campus lot only on days school is in session.
During holidays and on weekends, you would have to pay the normal parking rate.
With an unlimited pass, you can park in any lot on any day during the school year,
including weekends and holidays.
Like I said, between September 22nd and June 7th.
Hmm... how much do they cost?
A limited pass is $100, and an unlimited pass is $150.
All right, I'll buy an unlimited, I guess.
What do I have to do?
First, I'm going to give you a registration form.
This gives us information about your car.
Fill it out, and bring it back to me when you're ready.
You can pay by cash, check, or credit card.
Then, I'll give you a sticker to put on the corner of your windshield.
Make sure that sticker is in place when you park.
Otherwise, you will get a ticket.
No problem.
So, um, does this pass guarantee that I'll get a parking space?
I mean, are there, like, special places set aside in each lot for people with parking passes?
That's a good question.
Uh, unfortunately, the answer is no.
Parking is on a first-come, first-serve basis.
If a lot is full, you'll have to park somewhere else,
or wait until another car leaves.
I see.
How much does, um, regular parking cost? Without a pass?
It's two dollars an hour, or $10 a day.
You're getting an excellent deal.
Thank you.
Oh, just one more question.
Do you need all the money up front, or can I make payments?
I'm afraid I need it all at once. Sorry.
